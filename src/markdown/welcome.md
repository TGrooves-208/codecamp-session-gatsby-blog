#Boise Code Camp

**March 21, 2020** Come join us for Boise's #1 software developer event. Boise Code Camp is a free event for developers, hardware geeks, and the curious to come and learn from their peers. We'll even have free lunch! Interested? Learn more about Code Camp! And don't get lost the day of the eventâ€”read up on where we'll be.

##Day of the event

When the day of the event arrives we will have a full day worth of sessions ranging from databases, the latest development languages, mobile technologies, and much more. You want to see a session on that new technology you've been working with? Submit your own session! We can't do Code Camp without passionate people like you to speak.

##Young Coders

Do you have young coders? Are you a young person interested in technology? Boise Code Camp has an all-day track of coding and technology sessions aimed at youth ages 6 to 14.

###Code Camp Volunteers

Without volunteers a free event like this one cannot succeed. Whether you have a little or a lot of time to volunteer, we still need you.
